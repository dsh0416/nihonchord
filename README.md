[Rime](https://rime.im/) 日本和弦輸入方案

## 簡介

日本和弦 是一款爲 ANSI 或 ISO 鍵盤設計的多鍵並擊輸入日本語的方法，

本方案受啓發自 [佛振](https://github.com/lotem) 的 [宮保拼音](https://github.com/rime/home/wiki/ComboPinyin)。

並擊 (chord-typing) 是指：數指同時按下鍵盤上的多個按鍵。

## 特色

本輸入方案的特色是左手輸入元音和修飾符號，右手輸入對應的輔音，左右手同時敲擊。

輸入的感受如同左手彈奏根音，右手搭配上優美的旋律。

其解決了一些非日本語配列鍵盤上日本語的輸入問題，例如：
- 成音拍鼻音 ん 和成音拍阻音（促音）っ 有單獨按鍵。
- 輸入節奏與音節節奏一致。
- 利用有限的修飾鍵快速切換平仮名和片仮名。
- 輸入過程中可以儘可能降低雙手的移動幅度。
- 能夠快速輸入已經廢止的仮名，包括：𛀆㇙エ𛀁ゐヰゑヱ，關於「HIRAGANA LETTER ARCHAIC WU」待 Unicode 更新後加入。
- 對於更小型的鍵盤，例如 40% 便攜鍵盤，依然可以友好輸入。

由於濁音和拗音可能需要同時按下，而再按下 A 鍵的難度過大，於是我們重拍了元音部分，以方便手指更好按壓。而爲了方便記憶，我們對於右手邊輔音的位置也進行了一定重拍。使得やはからなま正好落在 i h k l n m 上。自上到下分別是

「綾沙た（ち）はわからな（い）み（たい）。」
