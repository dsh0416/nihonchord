[Rime](https://rime.im/) 日本和弦輸入方案

## 簡介

日本和弦 是一款爲 ANSI 或 ISO 鍵盤設計的多鍵並擊輸入日本語的方法，

本方案受啓發自 [佛振](https://github.com/lotem) 的 [宮保拼音](https://github.com/rime/home/wiki/ComboPinyin)。

並擊 (chord-typing) 是指：數指同時按下鍵盤上的多個按鍵。

## 特色

本輸入方案的特色是左手輸入元音和修飾符號，右手輸入對應的輔音，左右手同時敲擊。

輸入的感受如同左手彈奏根音，右手搭配上優美的旋律。

其解決了一些非日本語配列鍵盤上日本語的輸入問題，例如：
- 成音拍鼻音 ん 和成音拍阻音（促音）っ 有單獨按鍵。
- 輸入節奏與音節節奏一致。
- 利用有限的修飾鍵快速切換平仮名和片仮名。
- 輸入過程中可以儘可能降低雙手的移動幅度。
- 能夠快速輸入已經廢止的仮名，包括：𛀆㇙エ𛀁ゐヰゑヱ，關於「HIRAGANA LETTER ARCHAIC WU」待 Unicode 更新後加入。

Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its

NO WARRANTY

The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the

any right of any third party.

Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to

otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.

Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other

with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
"use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
modification, copying and distribution of the program and the

In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
